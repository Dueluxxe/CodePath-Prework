# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Kelly Pham**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/light-and-memory-game-pre-work)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   geeksforgeeks.org, w3schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I feel like the most challenging part of the pre-work is understanding the material and figuring out how to write my own implementation for the game.
   The instructions are simple and clear to follow, however, when it comes to concepts, such as the difference between an id and a class in HTML, it can
   be quite difficult to comprehend. There were expandable boxes to further explain the concept, but I feel that to truly understand what is going on in
   the program, I need an in-depth explanation of it. Without a concrete knowledge of what I am working with, it becomes a hurdle to utilize the features
   in the Light and Memory Game. This proves to be difficult especially when I encourage myself to take on challenging, optional features.
   However, with online resources that expanded the definitions I needed to understand, I better comprehend the overall bases of either HTML, CSS,
   or JavaScript. There are many websites that answered any questions that came to mind when I needed and multiple explanations of the same topic.
   This allowed me to take different understanding of the term and develop a definition that not only I comprehended, but also, took account from the
   explanations. The websites were especially vital, since I can get examples of for instance, function inheritance in JavaScript, and explore any other
   functions or attributes I needed when creating features on my own. I took majority of the time I have available to mainly digest key terms and any new
   code I have been told to implement, regardless of whether it was required. When realizing that an id references a particular element compared to the class
   referencing a group of elements, I began to fully visualize the structure of the code and come to understand the program better. It might be a small detail
   for understanding HTML but having to understand that simple concept made it easier for me to understand complex ideas such as how the Sound Synthesis Functions
   worked. Even if the two topics originated from different programming languages, by taking little steps, it becomes much easier to see the full picture of the entire code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   When it comes to web development, it is not necessary how the program worked that I am curious about, but mainly
   the interaction of a web developer with their team and what they do to make the program. Like for example, I wonder
   about the tasks that a web developer must take on daily. Or when designing the website, how are factors like maintainability,
   maintenance, performance, design, and security involved in web development? How does a web developer approach any bugs that
   occur or manage their code? When in the development cycle, how long does each phase takes to make the finish products? These
   questions are just few of the questions I have in mind about being a web developer overall. When it comes to understanding the code,
   I feel like it takes understanding each attribute, functions, etc., to full grasp the conceptâ€¦which can be understood by searching the
   key terms online. Learning object-oriented programming may take time to understand and might be easier if it is explained from someone,
   for instance, understanding polymorphism and generic functions. However, to understand the role of a web developer requires experience
   from a person. So, those are some of the questions I have about web development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would focus on adding more features to make the Light and Memory game have multiple levels. For example, I want to add a menu that displays three levels of difficulty,
   from easy, intermediate, and hard. This would allow space for me to add multiple features to increase the difficulty and to explore what more I can do with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The higher the level, the more features
   added to match the scale of the challenge. Certain features I wanted to add on are Frequency patterns, push patterns, time incrementation, and button dislocation. What I mean by Frequency pattern has to do with matching the
   sounds of the button without a recognizable color to the button, making the user guess the button purely by sound. The Push patterns will have to do with matching the length of the button pressed down, depending on how long
   the sound of the button extends. This would make the user have to really use their ears to match the timing, and the computer would give a rough estimated time it would let the user move on. The time incrementation would be
   added along with the limited amount of time feature, where if the user guesses the right button correctly, the user gets extra time. Finally, the button dislocation will randomize the position of the button in which the user
   would have to pay close attention of the lighting of the button. Each of these features would need modification of the Simon Says game board, but by adding the implementations, it would help increase the difficulty of the game
   and also update the visuals of the Light and Memory game board.
